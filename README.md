# Path-Finder
This project has the purpose of showing how these algorithms work. The GUI was made with Swing (Java).

There are 4 kinds of algorithms available: 

### *Depth-First search*
This algorithm is unweighted and **doesn't** guarantee the shortest path.

### *Breadth-First search*
This is an unweighted algorithm which guarantees the shortest path.

### *Dijkstra's algorithm*
It finds the shortest path no matter if the graph is weighted or unweighted, although it works just like BFS on unweighted graphs. 

### *A** *algorithm*
The fastest algorithm when we have to search for the shortest path. It guarantees the shortest path in both weighted and unweighted graphs. For the heuristics i used Manhattan distance.
